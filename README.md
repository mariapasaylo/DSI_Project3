# Description
This project develops a computational pipeline to identify photovoltaic materials that can endure space conditions while delivering strong energy output. It combines machine learning screening on JARVIS data with targeted quantum calculations using DFT+eDMFT to evaluate radiation tolerance. Final candidates are assessed with OMERE to predict end of life performance in orbit. The result is a concise list of promising space ready PV materials and a streamlined workflow for future discovery efforts.
